    <li><h3>One Piece</h3></li>
    <p>Years ago, the fearsome pirate king Gold Roger disappeared, leaving a huge pile of treasure 
        and the famous “One Piece” behind. Whoever claims the “One Piece” will be named the new pirate king. 
        Luffy D. Monkey, a boy who consumed the “Devil's Fruit”, has it in his head that he'll follow 
        in the footsteps of his idol, the pirate Shanks, and find the One Piece.
